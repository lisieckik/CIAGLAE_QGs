# CIAGALE_QGs
This is not original CIGALE repository. If you are looking for the original one: https://gitlab.lam.fr/cigale/cigale/


Here, I add non-parametric starformation history in two forms:
1. Usual attempt, with t student distribution for limiting the SFR change between each step.
2. Iyer+24 attempt, with 5 parameters with physical motivation used for regulation.

The idea behind the repository is simple. You have working CIGALE v2022 distribution. Download my repo. Merge directories.
